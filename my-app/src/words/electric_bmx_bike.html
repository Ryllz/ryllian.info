“Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should” 

This project makes no sense from a performance perspective - I built it because I wanted a BMX bike that went really really fast, and it delivered on that end in spades.

The build consisted of the following key components:
- Adaptto Mini-E controller and BMS (4kW nominal output)
- 4x 8Ah 4s1p LiPo packs (59.2V nominal, 67.2V max, 30C continuous/40C burst)
- MXUS v3 3kW “Turbo” motor, 4T winding

The really cool feature of the Adaptto controller is also the integrated charging feature, where the windings in the hub motor itself are used as part of the buck/boost circuit.

Highlights
From calculations based on wheel size, motor winding turns and battery pack voltage, I was expecting a top speed of ~60km/h. In practice my courage topped out at 50km/h and that’s where I limited it :) 

The peak current output capability of 180A was never tested, which is a shame…


Downsides
- The bike had rear v-brakes only, so while getting to 50km/h was a blip (less than ~3s), slowing down was a much bigger deal.

- Complete lack of suspension made it impractical when riding bumpy roads or hopping curbs are necessary.

- Questionable torque arm design which could cause fatigue failure in the rear frame member it’s bracing against, due to the cyclic loading of heavy acceleration and regen braking.

Lessons Learned
- I massively overestimated my bike-riding capabilities when I set out to build this.

- Straight spokes somehow work?? Defies load calculations (even assuming a few degrees deflection, it shouldn’t work for the forces involved - but yet it does).

- Circuit breaker ratings can be very finicky to choose.
