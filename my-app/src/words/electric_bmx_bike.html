<div>This project makes no sense from a performance perspective - I built it because I wanted a BMX bike that went really really fast, and it delivered on that end in spades.&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div>The build consisted of the following key components:</div>
<ul>
<li>Adaptto Mini-E controller and BMS (4kW nominal output)</li>
<li>4x 8Ah 4s1p LiPo packs (59.2V nominal, 67.2V max, 30C continuous/40C burst)</li>
<li>MXUS v3 3kW &ldquo;Turbo&rdquo; motor, 4T winding</li>
</ul>
<div>The really cool feature of the Adaptto controller is also the integrated charging feature, where the windings in the hub motor itself are used as part of the buck/boost circuit.</div>
<br>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<div>From calculations based on wheel size, motor winding turns and battery pack voltage, I was expecting a top speed of ~60km/h. In practice my courage topped out at 50km/h.</div>
<br>
<div>Thus the peak current output capability of 180A was never tested, which is a shame&hellip;</div>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
<ul>
<li>The bike had rear v-brakes only, so while 50km/h was a smooth ~2.5s throttle blip away, slowing down was a much more dramatic ordeal.</li>
<li>Complete lack of suspension made it impractical when riding bumpy roads or hopping curbs are necessary. The hub motor was also HEAVY (I had over-spec'ed with plans to upgrade to a 12kW controller initially).</li>
<li>Torque arm design which is susceptible to fatigue failure, due to the cyclic loading of heavy acceleration and regen braking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>I massively overestimated my bike-riding capabilities when I set out to build this.</li>
<li>Straight spokes somehow work?? Defies load calculations (even assuming a few degrees deflection, it shouldn&rsquo;t work for the forces involved - but yet it does).</li>
<li>Circuit breaker ratings can be very finicky to choose.</li>
<li>Tons of battery related things (how to build packs from various battery types, battery management systems, charging profiles etc.).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
