<h1>My first CNC wood router</h1>

<p>I built this CNC mill during university, having gotten interested in CAM processes during my final year project. 

- Arduino Uno + gShield, later upgraded to a TinyG board.
- V-wheel guide system and GT timing belt.
- 2.5kW air cooled ER11 collet 10k RPM spindle

Lessons learned
Noise
Environmental contaminants
Rigidity
