As with many of my romantic gifts, I took a simple objective (get a box for an engagement ring) and turned it into a project. 

Two things which I experimented with on this particular design was:

1. Altering machining path in CAM to create a subtle sunburst patterned surface finish (who said engineers are all about function?).

2. 3D printing gear profiles.

The former was very successful, the latter was a painful exercise in guesswork.
Tying into this, was the deceptively complicated mechanism required to raise the ring on a platform as the lid is opened.

Overall I was happy with the exterior aesthetics but the interior surfaces and mechanisms left a lot to be desired:

- The lid needed to be made super light otherwise the key/lock mechanism would jam, but this ended up in the underside looking very “space-age” which I wasn’t happy with.

- The mechanism itself doesn’t run particularly smoothly due to flex in the 3D printed parts (esp. the linkages). But as pointed out to me by a coworker at the time: “it only needs to open well once”.
