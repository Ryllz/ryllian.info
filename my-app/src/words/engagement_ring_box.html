I took a simple objective (get a box for an engagement ring) and turned it into a project. 
Originally, I'd given myself a week to complete the design and build - unfortunately due to breaking some long-reach tooling, I had to re-design on the fly with what was available.
After drawing out the box exterior in record time, I figured why not challenge myself with an unnecessarily complicated mechanism which raises the ring on a platform as the lid is opened, for that extra wow factor.

A few things which I experimented with on this particular project was:

1. Altering machining path in CAM to create a subtle sunburst patterned surface finish (who said engineers are all about function?).

2. 3D printing gear profiles on a Stratasys Objet24.

3. Lasercutting of exotic materials (shell inlay panels).

The cosmetic CAM cycle paths worked surprisingly well (Fusion360 by far is the most user friendly CAM suite I've used - and I've used a LOT).
3D printing gear profiles on an resin jet printer was however a huge pain, for a few reasons:

- Unpredictable warpage from water absorption during the wash processes
- When printing with a gloss finish, the "flashing" from the matte support areas messes with uniformity of the gear profile.
- When printing with a matte finish, the surface roughness causes pre-mature wear on the gear contact points, leading to sloppiness in the engagement.

I've since built a halogen light rig to address both the water absorption issue by giving a more thorough and even cure than leaving it on bench.
As for the other pain points - possible I could've worked around it by changing print orientation and splitting some complex parts, but resin amount limitations prevented experimenting with this.

Again, owing to the original design needing to be scrapped and re-done to accomodate using the part of the aluminum billet block that wasn't mangled when the long-reach cutter broke.

Overall I was happy with the exterior aesthetics but the interior surfaces and mechanisms left plenty of room for improvement:

- The lid needed to be made super light otherwise the key/lock mechanism would jam, but this ended up in the underside looking very “space-age” which I wasn’t happy with.
- The mechanism itself doesn’t run particularly smoothly due to flex in the 3D printed parts (esp. the linkages). But as pointed out to me by a coworker at the time: “it only needs to open well once”.
