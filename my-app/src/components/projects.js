                    <hr/>
                        <p>This project makes no sense from a performance perspective; I built it because I wanted a BMX bike that went really really fast, and it delivered on that end 100%.
                        <br></br>The build consisted of the following key components:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Adaptto Mini-E controller and BMS (4kW nominal output)</b></li>
                        <li><b>4x 8Ah 4s1p LiPo packs (59.2V nominal, 67.2V max, 30C continuous/40C burst)</b></li>
                        <li><b>MXUS v3 3kW &ldquo;Turbo&rdquo; motor, 4T winding</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The really cool feature of the Adaptto controller is also the integrated charging feature, 
                            where the windings in the hub motor itself are used as part of the buck/boost circuit.
                            From calculations based on wheel size, motor winding turns and battery pack voltage, I was expecting a top speed of ~60km/h. In practice my courage topped out at 50km/h.</p>
                        <p>Thus the peak max speed at ~67V and max accelerations at 180A remains untested...&hellip;</p>
                    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                    <hr/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The bike had rear v-brakes only, so while 50km/h was a smooth ~2.5s throttle blip away, slowing down was a much more dramatic ordeal.</li>
                        <li>Complete lack of suspension made it impractical when riding bumpy roads or hopping curbs are necessary. The hub motor was also HEAVY (I had over-spec'ed with plans to upgrade to a 12kW controller initially).</li>
                        <li>Torque arm design which is susceptible to fatigue failure, due to the cyclic loading of heavy acceleration and regen braking.</li>
                        <li>An enclosure for the battery/controller that's rated for some puddle smashiong (IP64/5 or thereabouts), and more aesthetically pleasing (though the scrap copper sheet and recycled hose clamps do give it some character).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <hr/>
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>I massively overestimated my bike-riding capabilities when I set out to build this.</b><br></br>
                        In other words, always remember spec things to the lowest common denominator...
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Simple ideas are worth trying first.</b><br></br>
                        Due to the large hub motor size, I struggled to find a suitable rim given the desired spoke angle I'd calculated (based on normal spoke gauges). 
                        Poking around on Google, I'd initially found some other people using 0 degree spoke angles but with extra thick gauge spokes;
                        I quickly dismissed this as being too 'simple', plus it also felt wrong defying the spoke load calculation assumptions on all loads being purely tension). 
                        I then spent the longest time fussing around with custom rim designs, before caving in and giving this a go first - and it was a bittersweet experience when I found it worked great!</li>
                        <li><b>Always have a healthy distrust for component specifications.</b><br></br>
                        Specifically, cheap circuit breakers definitely have a lot of wiggle room with respect to their specified trip current curves.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Tons of battery related things</b><br></br>
                        How to build packs from LiPo and Li-ion batteries, battery management systems, charging profiles etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h1>Romance wrapped in a DFM Crash Course</h1>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>I took a simple objective (get a box for an engagement ring) and turned it into a project. 
                        Originally, I'd given myself a week to complete the design and build - unfortunately due to breaking some long-reach tooling I'd depended on, I had to re-design on the fly with what was available.</p>
                    <p>After drawing out the box exterior in record time, I figured why not challenge myself by adding an unnecessarily complicated mechanism which raises the ring on a platform as the lid is opened, for that extra wow factor.</p>
                    <p>A few things which I experimented with on this particular project was:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Altering machining path in CAM to create a subtle sunburst patterned surface finish (who said engineers are all about function?).</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>3D printing custom gear profiles.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Laser-cutting of exotic materials (Paua shell inlay panels).</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The cosmetic "sunburst" milling paths worked surprisingly well. 
                        I started this project in Fusion360 as it was free for hobbyist use (not anymore though I think?). 
                        I was pleasantly surprised by the user friendliness of the CAM module; beating out edgeCAM, NX CAM, MasterCAM and CAMWorks for UX. 
                        While to achieve this it cuts a lot of advanced settings for surfacing and milling cycles, this is a good compromise in my opinion (as that a lot of it was clutter anyways for 1% edge case operations).</p>
                    <p>3D printing gear profiles on an resin jet printer was however a huge pain, for a few reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unpredictable warpage from water absorption during the wash processes</li>
                        <li>When printing with a gloss finish, the "flashing" from the matte support areas messes with uniformity of the gear profile.</li>
                        <li>When printing with a matte finish, the surface roughness causes pre-mature wear on the gear contact points, leading to sloppiness in the engagement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I've since built a halogen light rig to address both the water absorption issue by giving a more thorough and even cure than leaving it on bench.
                    As for the other pain points - possible I could've worked around it by changing print orientation and splitting some complex parts, but resin amount limitations prevented experimenting with this.</p>
                    <p>Overall I was happy with the exterior aesthetics but the interior surfaces and mechanisms left plenty of room for improvement:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>The lid needed to be made super light otherwise the key/lock mechanism would jam, but this ended up in the underside looking very &ldquo;space-age&rdquo; which I wasn&rsquo;t happy with.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The mechanism itself doesn&rsquo;t run particularly smoothly due to flex in the 3D printed parts (esp. the linkages). But as pointed out to me by a coworker at the time: &ldquo;it only needs to open well once&rdquo;.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Coolant type is critical.</strong></li>
                        <p>Different coolant strategies for material types, as well as trade-offs in cut finish and rubbing marks.</p>
                        <li><strong>Milling techniques for ultra small parts.</strong></li>
                        <p>Lots of double sided tape and conservative cutting strategies. Pneumatic vice setup on the Datron Neo used for this project were also amazingly handy.</p>
                        <li><strong>3D printing tolerances and the importance of post-processing.</strong></li>
                        <p>...and the design tweaks required to get around them.</p>
