                <p>One of the biggest bottlenecks in plasma cutting production is needing to pause the machine for the operator to unload the processed parts from the cutting table.</p>
                <p>The requirement brief when I designed this machine was to automate that aspect, and enable significant improvements to production planning by eliminating plasma cutting downtime.</p>
                <p>In simplistic terms - instead of humans climbing all over the cutting table and picking out parts, a motion platform with some really clever software and adjustable electromagnets do the job!</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>To breakdown the differences in operation procedure:</p>

                        <li>Plates to be processed are loaded onto the cutting bed via crane</li>

                        <li>Cut parts are picked out of the plate skeletons</li>
                        <li>Plate skeletons are removed, and process repeated from the step 1</li>

                    This project evolved dramatically from early stages to the built design. Early detailed concepts were more akin to a automated crane, but ultimately the design was completely redone to the nested frame design seen in the video below.
                    <br/>
                    The ultra-compact profile of the unloader is what allows it to pass underneath the main cutting gantry and fundamentally enables its un-interrupted processing capabilities.

                <h3>Cool Features & Lessons Learned</h3>
                <hr></hr>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Designed for a huge range of part sizes</b></li>
                    <p>For the unloader to operate effectively, it must be able to pickup >90% of parts.</p>
                    <p>To enable this, a range of magnet sizes and shapes are used, with controllable adjustable spacing on the most popular size </p>
                    <li><b>Telescoping mechanisms</b></li>
                    <p>The unloader's pick/place unit telescopes in order to have pickup coverage of the entire work area, while also able to extend into the palletizing zone.</p>
                    <p>A lot of time was spent looking into the mechanisms used in forklifts and compact cranes, but a unique hybrid solution was eventually developed specific to our application.</p>
                    <p>There's a host of cool design features that enable the compact yet powerful pickup unit</p>
                    <li><b>AGV on rails</b></li>
                    <p>To ensure the safety of operators who may wander into the palletizing zones (or even the cutting table), all sides of the unloader are covered by LiDAR.</p>
                    <p>This required the sensors to be housed on pneumatic arms in order to raise/lower as needed for appropriate coverage, as well as positive pressure enclosures designed to prevent dust accumulation on any sensor lens.</p>
                    <p>These systems were all tied together by some brilliant programming from the software team, dynamically adjusting zones and platform behaviour.</p>
                    <p>All in all, with all the dynamic logic and electro-mechanical safety systems added, at the end of the project it felt like we'd almost built an AGV on rails!</p>
                    <li><b>Electromagnets are magic when applied correctly</b></li>
                    <p>A significant effort was involved in learnign about and sourcing electromagnets with the right mix of properties; shape, pickup force, temperature resistance etc.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the magnets themselves, they needed to be mounted with enough flex to accomodate natural plate deflection between each magnet due to gravity.</p>
                    <p>Without this flex system (which also needs to reset after each pickup), pickup payload is significantly reduced due to "peeling" effect.</p>
                </ul>
