                    <h2>Full stack dev, but not really</h2>

                    <p>I've dabbled before in graphical design and HTML/CSS, and always wanted to learn more about what's behind the scenes. </p>
                    <p>As a lot of my automation projects at Apple also started involved integration with internal web services, I took the leap and did a IBM Full Stack Cloud Development course.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Why did I choose an IBM course? The content seemed like a good mix of stuff I was already semi-familiar with and new topics, which is always a comfortable learning environment.</p>
                    <p>Admittedly, I also park my car in an IBM building and all the IBM branded signage everywhere must've worked their subliminal magic...</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Despite finishing the course, I still wouldn't qualify myself as a full stack dev though (hence not listing JS, Kubernetes, Docker etc. on my skills list). <br></br>
                        This is due to a mixture of narrow scope covered in the course, shallow depth of content, and of course also a good dose of imposter syndrome :')</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                    To try put some of the new knowledge to work though, I embarked on building this site out using the React.js framework for the backend/middleware and Material Design Lite (MDL) for the frontend theme. 
                    Having used Shopify and Squarespace before, it felt good to have complete control over customisation despite the extra work required to setup even the most mundane things.

                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interoperability is a nightmare</strong></li>
                    <p>Making sure all design elements are supported by common browsers (and resize correctly), is something that I think most people take for granted when visitng websites.
                    The sheer effort required to create a seamless experience across mobile + tablet + desktop browser(s) is staggering. 
                    For the most part I implemented some flex grids and called it a day :)</p>
                    <li><strong>The cascade in CSS is real</strong></li>
                    The ability to hone in and tweak a specific sub-element is really neat, while the "superset" default nature of CSS really makes changing themes site wide a breeze.
                    Finally perfecting a CSS palette and rolling it out across all pages with a click, is a joyful experience.
                    <li><strong>It's turtles all the way down</strong></li>
                    One of the most frustrating things when trying to really understand why something doesn't work, is chasing the bug through layers and layers of abstraction.
                    My experience with debugging C# and Python apps, led me to become complacent in being able to generally only need to step a few layers/dependences down to figure out why X input gives Y results.
                    However, with React.js and HTML/CSS, often times weird behaviour is significantly more difficult to understand and fix.
                    <li><strong>Readability and commenting across languages </strong></li>
                    Simply, I found commenting in JS/HTML/CSS a pain.
                    The flow just isn't the same, as my habitual commenting in Python and C# felt more effortless (the // and # markers are incredibly easy to write in line).
                    Probably just me not being familiar with VSCode (and laziness).
                    <li><strong>Nested curly brackets, ugh</strong></li>
                    Sometimes a line of code will have just a soup of />)} characters and it honestly makes me want to cry when debugging.
                    Nesting data objects within data objects, within an inline function, also just feels plain wrong a lot of times.
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Thoughts on the IBM Course</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Listed as suitable for a beginners course</strong></li>
                    I personally would've struggled without prior programming experience (and a smart SWE brother I could bug for nitty gritty questions!).
                    <li><strong>Too much reliance on copy/pasting, not enough deep technical explanations</strong></li>
                    A lot of the guided online labs were "do X when Y, as we showed you" as opposed to "X is used when Y, because of Z".
                    <li><strong>Cheating was rife - when going on the Q&A forums, I saw a LOT of people requesting shady quid-pro-quo peer marking arrangements. The IBM team didn't seem to care about this.</strong></li>
                    Of course as with all online courses, cheating is inevitable (the exam work handed in is hosted on public github repos), but seeing it brazenly happen in the official Q&A forum without moderators stepping in was baffling.
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Fancy Certificate</h3>
                    <em><b>Note</b> - I did this course early 2022, and there's since been an extra quiz and seperate Git section added.
                        Hopefully future me will get around to updating this certificate after completing the 2 new extra sections...
