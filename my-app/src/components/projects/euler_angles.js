                            <h4>Background</h4>
                            <p>One of the projects I undertook during my time at Apple was to try and improve the accuracy of some Mecademic Meca500 R3 robots.</p>
                            <p>During the course of improving the performance of some pick/place type test cells, I'd resolved most of the other "low hanging fruit" in the error stack which were mostly fixture design improvements.</p>
                            <br></br>
                            <p>This left 2 key things on the to-do list:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Create a semi-automatic probe based calibration system to replace the pre-existing visual alignment process, for setting the positions of the co-ordinate frames used by the test cell.</li>
                                <br></br>
                                <li>Improve the calibration of the robot itself somewhere along the below scale:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Level 1</b> <p>Improved joint mastering, i.e. take real measurements to update joint homing offsets closer to real life vs. OEM nominal.</p></li>
                                    <li><b>Level 2</b> <p>Full kinematic calibration, i.e. joint lengths and other angular offsets as defined in the 4x4 transform matrix for each joint.</p></li>
                                    <li><b>Level 3</b> <p>Throw everything else we can think of into a dynamic model, i.e. joint deflection, backlash, temperature variation etc.</p>
                                    <p>This typically requires a 3rd party software like ROS or RoboDK as an interface to control the robot, as opposed to just updating controller parameters.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </ol>
                            <p>To keep things brief I'll skip the discussing too deep around item 2, and focus on the key learning from accomplishing item 1:
                            <br></br>Specifically, what are Euler angles and how the heck does the math work behind the general solutions given.</p>
                            <h4>What?</h4>
                            <p>Euler angles are a set of 3 values, which can be used to define the angular orientation of a point in space. </p>
                            <p>To fully define a point in 3D space we require an XYZ value to determine the linear cartesian position, alongside a set of Euler angles to determine the angular orientation.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.mecademic.com/en/how-is-orientation-in-space-represented-with-euler-angles">This excellent article from Mecademic explains this concept further in great detail.</a></p>
                            <h4>Why?</h4>
                            <p>As the accuracy of a robot movement heavily depends on the accurate definition of the tool "tip" location and any key work area co-ordinates, attempting to set these values manually would be an extremely tedious process; hence the need for an automated tool to accomplish this.</p>

                            <h4>How?</h4>
                            <p>So what I wanted to cover in this post (and will hopefully help anyone who stumbles on this via googling Euler angles for a Meca500), is how do we arrive at the general solution presented on that page? <br></br>I hope you enjoy the following refresher in trignometric functions/identities :)</p>

                            <p>While I can't dive too much into the application I did specifically (most of it to do with re-creating the OEM web UI with pyQT to wrap the calibration functions), <a href="https://support.mecademic.com/support/solutions/articles/64000248048-how-do-i-calculate-the-wrf-using-a-3-point-method-">this article from Mecademic expresses the 2/3 of the core logic much more elegantly.</a></p>
