                    <h2>What makes a good story?</h2>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>To get to the point, I think it really boils down to a simple rule:</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p><em>A good story must start with a captivating promise, and fulfill that promise to arrive at a satisfying pay-off.</em></p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>It feels like modern media content has transitioned away from this though, to go for shock and awe with non-sensical twists.</p>
                    <p>Like ordering a BBQ pizza, but getting switcharoo'd with a vegetarian one; in theory if it's done right it could be equal or better, and delight the customer with a wonderful new experience.</p>
                    <p>But in practice most chefs lack the skill and should just be giving the customer exactly what they ordered and expect.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>A part of me is jaded feeling like this trend is a tactic to milk more money out of audiences by padding a series/book/game with non-stop twists. </p>
                    <p>Or perhaps market research shows we (the audience) are just too easily bored now; but that would mean my complaints are just because I'm becoming out of touch? I hope not...</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Thus I'd like to start off the next section of this rambling post by pointing to 2 examples to back up my complaints:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A Song of Ice and Fire (both TV and book series)</b></li>
                        <li><b>Kingdom Hearts</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr/>
                    <h3>A Song of Ice and Fire (AKA Game of Thrones)</h3>
                    <b>Where to even begin with this...</b>
                    <p>I was a huge fan of George RR Martin before he was cool; I read all his books (even the weird vampire one) and Game of Thrones defined books for me in my mid-teens.</p>
                    <p>So much so that I'd read the entirety of "Feast for Crows" as bootleg .txt file on a 1.5" mp3 player screen.</p>
                    <p>I'd simply never read a series before with such momentum. It was chapter after chapter of death/drama/politics/sex and the hype train just kept picking up speed.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>Fast forward ~10 years</b>
                    <p>I'm in University and Dance with Dragons has just come out. The TV series has also just started, but I don't care as I'm a loyalist to the book.</p>
                    <p>I spend all my free time reading it and come away puzzled and disappointed...did I outgrow the series, or was this just bad?</p>
                    <p>After spending some time I realised it was a bit of both, but mostly the latter. The pacing had slowed dramatically and the number of plot threads had reached absurd levels.</p>
                    <p>You know things are bad when fans recommend a series primer and a wiki to refer to, in order to keep track of all the new characters being introduced.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>Fast forward to 2021</b>
                    <p>Winds of Winter is still "coming soon" after half decade of hyping how close it is to release.</p>
                    <p>The TV show has also concluded a few years prior, and I'd sadly caved and watched it all to find out how the series ends. <b>Spoiler alert:</b> It was heartbreaking.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>Why does this hurt me so?</b>
                    <p>The series just had so much potential - and I don't believe I'll ever be as captivated by a work of fiction.</p>
                    <p>In that context, my disappointment stems from an overwhelming sense of pity when thinking about <em>what could have been.</em> <br></br>Like reminiscing about a perfect first love who turned out to have only been with you for the money.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>All the fantastic mysteries and intrigue promised in the first few books, yet they'll remain forever unfulfilled or unfold in the TV series into baffling abrupt dead-ends (Night King stabbed to death by Arya??) and yo-yo character arc swings (Jaime and Cersei)...</p>
                    <h3>Kingdom Hearts</h3>
                    <p>The first game in this series was an absolute brilliant collaboration between Square Enix and Disney, appealing to a huge audience and nailing a plot centered on friendship.</p>
                    <p>You start the story on the aptly named Destiny Islands, and the prologue crafts a touching story of childhood friendship and possible love triangle between 3 of the main characters.</p>
                    <p>Going through the game, the story explores the themes of self sacrifice and what it means to be a good friend. After fighting your way towards reuniting the trio, everything culminates in a bittersweet cliffhanger ending where the heroes are separated yet again.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>Fast forward to 2021</b>
                    <p>I've totally lost track of the number sequels, which have been spread across every platform possible to milk money out of the fans.</p>
                    <p>3 hour long Youtube lectures are popular among remaining fans, to explain the unrecognizable spaghetti ball of a plot.</p>
                    <p>Time travel now exists, as does cloning, weird behind-the-scenes illuminati groups and sub-groups, along with other hand-wavey magicks. The cast has also ballooned to the point where even "main" characters had the depth of a puddle.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <b>Why do I care so much?</b>
                    <p>This was a series that could've grown with the fanbase and defined JRPGs + Disney characters for a generation.</p>
                    <p>The first game built a solid foundation on a promise of adventure, friendship and the triumph of good vs. evil in peoples' hearts.</p>
                    <p>Later games added levels and levels of rickety M.C. Escher apartments ontop of this foundation - with Disney wallpaper raggedly plastered on for merchandising.</p>
                    <p>Overall I guess I'm just plain sad I'll never get a straightforward happy ending to satisfy my childhood nostalgia.</p>
                    <br></br>
