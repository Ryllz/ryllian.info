                    <h2>Nice things</h2>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>As a fresh adult going into University, I vividly recall setting a pretty simplistic goal of attaining:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A nice place to live</li>
                        <li>Cool car</li>
                        <li>Something that floats to fish from</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lately as I achieve more and more of these material goals, I've grown more and more understanding of why "mid-life crisis" is a thing - and slightly resentful of the mechanics at play.</p>
                    <p>I don't mean this in the stereotypical "mo' money, less time" dilemna (though true), as I've always been pretty good at maintaining a work/life balance.</p>
                    <p>What really struck me though, is how nothing is really attainable in a completionist sense. Let's revisit my list to demonstrate what I mean:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A nice place to live</b> - that costs thousands per year in council rates, utilities, and 1%/yr of total value for maintenance.</li>
                        <li><b>Cool car</b> - fuel is expensive, tyres and brakes are expensive, insurance is expensive, maintenance is expensive.</li>
                        <li><b>Something that floats to fish from</b> - basically a money sinkhole.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What I'm getting at is that it's hard to shift out of the mental model of "I've achieved it and now I'm set for life";</p> 
                    <p>Needing to confront the reality that the eat-work-sleep cycle must continue to sustain the earned lifestyle, was definitely a sad reality check.</p>
                    <p>Sure, you could "save enough and it'll be fine" but that's a much loftier goal. With dependents, extensions to retirement age, and the privatisation of healthcare - 
                        you can never save enough to feel truly "free" as a paranoid person. The steady downwards creep of the balance sheet would be anxiety inducing without a massive surplus, leading me to my next point...</p>
                    <h4>Commoditization of neccessities</h4>
                    <hr></hr>
                    <p>I deeply resent how the housing market has gotten to the point whereupon having a roof over your head is being scalped like a concert ticket.</p>
                    <p>Housing should not be an investment, and the current situation in all the major cities really highlights an end to any semblance of meritocracy in society.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Being DINKs (Dual Income No Kids) in well paid professional careers, my family statistically is doing great and we're very fortunate to be where we are.</p>
                        <p>I preface with this because when we were looking for a home, our "dream house" was being sold by a receptionist and general labourer with 2 kids, and passed in at auction for double what they paid just 5 years ago. 
                        Emphasis on <b>passed in</b> - as despite being "mom & pop investors", the owners expected higher returns than a measly 100%/5y.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Yes highlighting their professions is perhaps a bit judgemental and classist - but I think it accurately captures the generational divide to a T;</p>
                    <p>When even the well paid professions of the next generation can't earn enough wages to keep up with house price growth, what's the end game?</p>
                    <p>What's the motivation for the bulk of your life going to be? Just being born after the 2000's basically means you're going to be a slave to paying off the roof over your head?</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>I guess my gripe isn't with my situation in particular, moreover a growing general sense of unfairness in how things are shaping up for the future (I'm not even going to start about climate change here).</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
