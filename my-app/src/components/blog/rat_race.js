                    <h2>Nice things</h2>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>As a teen going into University, I vividly recall setting a pretty simplistic goal of attaining:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A nice place to live</li>
                        <li>Cool car</li>
                        <li>Something that floats to fish from</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lately as I achieve more and more of these material goals, I've grown more and more understanding of why "mid-life crisis" is a thing - and slightly resentful of the mechanics at play.</p>
                    <p>I don't mean this in the stereotypical "mo' money, less time" dilemna (though true), as I've always been pretty good at maintaining a work/life balance.</p>
                    <p>What really struck me though, is how almost no material goal is attainable in a completionist sense. Let's revisit my list to demonstrate what I mean:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A nice place to live</b> - that costs thousands per year in council rates, utilities, and 1% of total value for maintenance.</li>
                        <li><b>Cool car</b> - 98 RON is expensive, tyres and brakes are expensive, maintenance is expensive.</li>
                        <li><b>Something that floats to fish from</b> - basically a money sinkhole, do I even need to extrapolate?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I guess what I'm getting at is that when I set out those material goals, in my mind everything was a "buy it once and set for life" deal.</p> 
                    <p>Confronting the reality that the eat-work-sleep cycle needs to continue to sustain ownership, even after attaining everything you wish to own.</p>
                    <p>Sure, you could "save enough and it'll be fine" but that's a much loftier goal. With dependents, extensions to retirement age, and the privatisation of healthcare - 
                        you can never save enough to feel truly "free" as a paranoid person. The steady downwards creep of the balance sheet would be anxiety inducing without a massive surplus, leading me to my next point...</p>
                    <h4>The real rat race</h4>
                    <hr></hr>
                    <p>Imagine running a marathon (or Ironman perhaps, if you're hardcore) whereupon you cross the finish line, happy with whatever placing you got - and then finding out you still need to walk home afterwards.</p>
                    <p>Because your car got towed. Because the event organisers took the money for parking and embezzled it on a wild party for themselves.</p>
                    <p>That's the true rat race from my perspective: not running to keeping up with the Jones'really, moreso trudging along trying to make the best of a crap situation caused by a few select people with too much power and too little empathy. 
                        Which leads me to my last point...</p>
                    <h4>Commoditization of neccessities</h4>
                    <hr></hr>
                    <p>I deeply resent how the housing market has gotten to the point whereupon having a roof over your head is being scalped like a concert ticket.</p>
                    <p>Housing should not be an investment, and the current situation in all the major cities really highlights an end to any semblance of meritocracy in society.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Being DINKs (Dual Income No Kids) in well paid professional careers, my family statistically is doing great and we're fortunate to be where we are.</p>
                        <p>Yet when we were looking for a home, our "dream house" was sold by a receptionist and general labourer with 2 kids, and passed in at auction for double what they paid just 5 years ago.</p>
                        <p><b>Passed in</b> being the key, as the owners were "mom & pop investors" who demanded higher returns than a measly 100%/5y. Yes highlighting their professions is perhaps a bit classist and irrelevant - but I think it accurately captures the crap situation to a T.</p>
                        <br></br>
                    <p>When even the very well paid of the next generation can't earn enough salary per year to keep up with house price growth, what's the end goal?</p>
                    <p>What's the motivation for the bulk of your life going to be, if by just being born after the 2000's basically means you're going to be a slave to paying off the roof over your head?</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>I guess my gripe isn't with my situation in particular, moreover a growing general sense of unfairness in how things are shaping up for the future (I'm not even going to start ranting about climate change here).</p>
                    <br></br>
