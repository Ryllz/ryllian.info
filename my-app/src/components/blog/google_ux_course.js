                        <p>This ad-hoc blog page hosts the 3 case study slides required as part of the final submission.</p>
                        <p>I've always suspected I wasn't destined to be an artist, which these will likely prove &#128517;</p>

                        <h2>Bedazzle</h2>
                        <p>This case study is for a webapp to provide a better shopping experience for bespoke jewelry; specifically with less cursive fonts and clear upfront pricing.</p>
                        <p>Not sure why I picked the name Bedazzle (my wife thinks it's disgustingly dorky for a hypothetically high end store) but nonetheless the double Z's spoke to me.</p>

                        <p>As a person with poor taste in interior design, this case study appealed to me as I've always felt "decorate my room" type collections are missing in most the art studio pages.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully someone from Society6, Redbubble or similar platform sees this and executes on the idea :)</p>

                        <p>The generated prompt for this one was "design a way to help tutor young adults in technical skills".</p>

                        <p>My main motivation for taking this course was to learn how to use the proper tools to quickly iterate and demonstrate user interfaces on desktop and mobile platforms. </p>
                        <p>I take pride in trying to make the software tools I write as intuitive and user friendly as possible, which typically involves hashing things out in various WYSIWYG form editors.</p>
                        <p>This has always been quite clunky to iterate with and significantly lacked actual design tools compared to actual UX design tools such as Figma and Adobe XD.</p>
                        <p>To that goal, I enjoyed learning how to use these tools in a structued format and knowing I can now spin up concepts substantially quicker!</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Although I rushed the deliverables a bit (i.e. please excuse any blatant copy/pasting across case studies), it was definitely interesting learning more about the science behind visual theme choices and typeface selection.
                            These were things which I had mostly just selected by gut feel before, which wasted a lot of time iterating and guessing. </p>
                        <p>Now I have endless bookmarks to refer to for helping lock down these details in a efficient way :)</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Lastly: coming from an engineering background where slide presentations are a lot denser with more meticulous focus on details, it was a refreshing change to play with the Google provided visual templates and populate them with some more squidgy/subjective topics.</p>
